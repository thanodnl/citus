-- Citus uses ssl by default now. It does so by turning on ssl and if needed generate self
-- signed certificates.
-- To test this we will verify that SSL is set to ON for all machines, and we will make
-- sure connections to workers use SSL by having it required in citus.conn_nodeinfo and
-- lastly we will inspect the ssl state for connections to the workers
-- ssl can only be enabled by default on installations of postgres 10 and above that has
-- ssl linked during compile time. When ssl is not linked during compile time it defaults
-- the ssl_ciphers setting to 'none'.
